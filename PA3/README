0. How to access the Dumbo cluster

    - Refer to BB announcement.

1. Implementation

    - Complete the unfinished parts, including the TODO parts, in matrixMul.cu

    - Write detailed comments to explain logic of your code.

2. $ make

3. Test 

    (1) For testing/debugging

    - In Dumbo master node.

    - run matrixMul with a small number of the row/column length.

    - $ sbatch -J 2mm -o %x_%N.o%j -e %x_%N.e%j -p gpu_edu -N 1 -n 1 -c 16 --gres=gpu:4 --time 00:20:00 --exclude=dumbo0[60,62,64-66,68-71] --wrap="./matrixMul 128"

    (2) Cluster evaluation

    - In Dumbo master node.

    - run submit_job.sh to submit your job to cluster

    - $ bash submit_job.sh
    : The submit_job.sh script submits a single job for matrix multiplication of two 2048 X 2048 matrices.

    - You can track your job process by $ squeue -j (job ID)

    - When your job is finished, you will get two output files. .e, .o. 
      Each file follows the naming format (job name)_(allocated node name).x(job ID), where x corresponds to e or o.

    - .e logs the error message of job and .o logs the output message of job.
