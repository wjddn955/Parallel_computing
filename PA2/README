0. How to access the Leopard cluster

    - Refer to BB announcements.

1. Implementation

    - Complete the unfinished parts, including the TODO parts, in mergesort.c

    - Write detailed comments to explain logic of your code.

2. $ make

3. Test

    (1) For testing/debugging

    - In Leopard master node.

    - run mergesort with a small number of the array elements. 

    - $ qsub -V -cwd -S /bin/bash -l h_rt=00:01:00 -q leopard-short.q -pe leopard-short 8 -N mpi.8 -o ./results -e ./results -b y mpirun -np 8 -machinefile \$TMPDIR/machines mergesort 1024

    (2) cluster evaluation

    - In Leopard master node.

    - run submit_jobs.sh to submit your jobs to cluster

    - $ bash submit_jobs.sh
    : The submit_jobs.sh script submits 6 jobs, each with a different number of processes. 

    - You can track your job process by $ qstat

    - When your job is finished, you will get four output files, .e, .o, .pe and .po. in the results directory. 
      Each file follows the naming format (job name).x(job ID), where x corresponds to e, o, pe, or po.

    - .e logs the error message of job and .o logs the output message of job. 
    
    - .pe logs the error message of parallel environment and .po logs the output message of parallel environment.
      If your job is successfully submitted and node allocation is completed, the .po will include the hostname of the allocated node.
